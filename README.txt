    #if you have issues getting into the virtual enviornment because the powershell script is not digitally signed,
    #type this in the terminal: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
    #IF you dont have a virtual enviornment, follow these steps:
        #PS C:\Users\<username>\GitHub\Project2HCI>
            #File>Settings> Project>Project2HCI>Python Interpreter> Add Python Interpreter > Virtualenv Environment > OK

    #Once you have a virtual environment library root enter this command in the terminal to enter your virtual enviorment
        # venv\scripts\activate
